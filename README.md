Configuration
-------------

    var window_title = 'My Own Server';  // Title text for the browser window.

    var default_origo = '#2_-2';         // Region where the map is centered by default.
                                         // You can also use alternative origos in URL:
                                         //     http://example.org/world_map_viewer.html#-3_7

    var tiles_baseurl = 'world_map/';    // Location of "tiles.html" (Relative to this file)
                                         // (Will be automatically appended to tile image URLs, etc.)

    var tiles_filename = 'tiles.html';   // "tiles.html" generated by TOGoS's Minecraft Map Renderer

    var tiles_html = null;               // Replace with 'table' (or other suitable DOM root)
                                         // if the table from "tiles.html" is actually at the end of this file.


Installation (with a web server)
--------------------------------

Drop this file to the same server where your tiles.html and
tile.x.z.png images are located.

Check that "tiles_baseurl" and "tiles_filename" are correct.
The tiles.html file should be available at:

    http://example.org/somedir/ tiles_baseurl + tiles_filename

(when this file is located at http://example.org/somedir/)


Installation (without a web server)
-----------------------------------

With Firefox you can use this file as-is. Just make sure that
"tiles_baseurl" points to a subdirectory where tiles.html and
tile.x.z.png images are located.

With Chrome/Chromium replace the <body> tag (at the end of this
file) with the version that is found at tiles.html. Change
"tiles_html" variable to:

        var tiles_html = 'table';

After that, make sure that "tiles_baseurl" points to a subdirectory
where tile.x.z.png images are located.

For offline use (no Internet connection) fetch jquery-2.1.0.min.js
and place it at the same directory as this file:

    http://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.0.min.js


Known issues
------------

"Sharpness" option sucks at Chrome/Chromium:

Internet Explorer is not supported. Use at your own risk.
